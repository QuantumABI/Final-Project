          Do you know how to look for eco-friendly electronic products?
        </h1>

        <p>
          In some electronic products, you might sometimes find the Energy Star
          label on the box. This means that the product is eco-friendlier and
          more economical than other similar products. Other than concerning
          specific products such as computers (Forbrukerrådet) and not being
          used in Norway anymore (Nilsen, 2016), most people might not realize
          what the Energy Star label represents. What would be the point of
          having a label no one knows about? It is a label that is supposed to
          help not only choose the better option for the environment, but also
          choose a cheaper alternative without sacrificing quality.
        </p>
      </div>

      <div class="vision">
        <h1 id="vision">Our Vision</h1>

        <p>
          What we need is a new label that is instantly recognizable. This label
          should be used on any and every product that you might find in an
          electronics store. Like the Energy Star label, it should tell you that
          this product is not only eco-friendly, but also cheaper. Examples of
          instantly recognizable labels are McDonalds’ and Apple. They are
          trusted brands where the former provides good food for cheap and the
          latter releases easy-to-use phones with innovative functions.
        </p>
        <p>
          While Norway mostly uses clean, renewable energy sources, not every
          country does so. Examples of non-renewable energy sources that damages
          the earth would be fossil fuel, natural gas, coal, and nuclear energy.
          With a growing population and increased demand for electronic
          products, the need to find a sustainable, renewable energy source is
          more important than ever.
        </p>
        <p>
          Until that day comes, having a label that is instantly recognizable
          can go a long way. If people know, with one look, that this product is
          not only cheaper, but also more eco-friendly than the alternatives, it
          will lessen the impact on the climate of the earth. Producing, using,
          and throwing away our products should be handled with the utmost care
          because so far, we only have one planet we can live in. It is in our
          best interest to help preserve this planet by any and every means
          necessary.

      <div class="firstSteps">
        <h2>The First Steps</h2>

        <p>
          While the new label, Eco+, might not solve all our problems, it
          certainly helps if people knows what would be the better choice for
          our planet. The first step would be to design the label. It should be
          simple and easily memorable like the McDonalds’ or Apple logo. The
          next step would be set clear-cut criteria to promote products that are
          more friendly to the environment, but also cheaper with the same or
          better quality than the alternatives.
          <b
            >Criteria should cover the production, use, and waste management of
            a product (how it is thrown away and the impact it would have if
            thrown away).</b
          >
        </p>
        <p>
          Customers know that choosing the eco-friendlier product is the right
          choice, but also making it cheaper will make it a no-brainer. Having
          one label to be used by any product eligible which are generally sold
          in electronics store also simplifies it (since it needs to be easily
          memorable). The label should be encouraged to be used worldwide, and
          that way, you know what that label means no matter where you go and
          buy a product.

      <div class="awareness">
        <h2>Spreading Awareness</h2>

        <p>
          It is also crucial to spread awareness. No matter how good a label
          looks, if no one knows or cares about it, it will not do any good.
          There are many ways to do this. Examples would be commercials (to be
          used both by TVs and sites like YouTube), advertising it in the
          stores, billboards, social media posts, memes etc. This should be done
          alongside with high-quality products. If people choose the
          eco-friendlier alternative, companies will put more emphasis on
          creating eco-friendlier products. That means the criteria cannot stay
          the same. If there are products that set a new standard on what
          eco-friendly means, then the criteria must follow suit. The criteria
          could also set the new standard of what the product should achieve
          when it comes to eco-friendliness.

          The idea for a new label is based on idea 12 from Emil’s assignment on
