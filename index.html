          In some electronic products, you might sometimes find the Energy Star
          label. This means that the product is eco-friendlier and more
          economical than other similar products. Other than concerning specific
          products such as computers (Forbrukerrådet) and not being used in
          Norway anymore (Nilsen, 2016), most people might not realize what this
          label represents. What would be the point of having a label no one
          knows about? It is a label that is supposed to help not only choose
          the better option for the environment, but also choose a cheaper
          alternative without losing quality.

          Ideally, the new label should be as recognizable as the McDonald’s
          brand or the Apple brand. They are trusted brands where the former
          provides good food and the latter easy-to-use phones with innovative
          functions. While Norway mostly uses clean, renewable energy sources,
          not every country does so. Examples of non-renewable energy sources
          that damages the earth would be fossil fuel, natural gas, coal, and
          nuclear energy. With a growing population and increased demand for
          electronic products, the need to find a sustainable, renewable energy
          source is more important than ever. Until that day comes, having a
          label that is instantly recognizable can go a long way. If people
          know, with one look, that this product is not only cheaper, but also
          more eco-friendly than the alternatives, it lessens the impact on the
          climate of the earth. Producing, using, and throwing away our products
          should be handled with the utmost care because so far, we only have
          one planet we can live in. It is in our best interest to help preserve
          this planet by any and every means necessary.

        <h2>The First Steps</h2>

        <p>
          While the new label might not solve all our problems, it certainly
          helps if people know what to look for, what the better choice is for
          our planet. The first step would be to design a label. It should be
          simple and easily memorable like the McDonalds’ or Apple logo. The
          next step would be set clear-cut criteria to promote products that are
          more friendly to the environment, but also cheaper with the same or
          better quality than the alternatives. Criteria should cover the
          production, use, and waste management of a product (how it thrown away
          and the impact it would have if thrown away). Customers know that
          choosing the eco-friendlier product is the right, but also making it
          cheaper makes it a no-brainer. Having one label to be used by any
          product eligible which are generally sold in electronics store also
          simplifies it (since it needs to be easily memorable). The label
          should be encouraged to be used worldwide, and that way, you know what
          that label means no matter where you go and buy a product.

        <h2>Spreading Awareness</h2>

        <p>
          It is also crucial to spread awareness. No matter how good a label is,
          if no one knows or cares about it, it won't do any good. There are
          many ways to do this. Examples would be commercials (to be used both
          by TVs and sites like YouTube), advertising it in the stores,
          billboards, social media posts, memes etc. This should be done
          alongside with high-quality products. If people choose the
          eco-friendlier alternative, companies will put more emphasis on
          creating eco-friendlier products. That means the criteria cannot stay
          the same. If there are products that set a new standard on what
          eco-friendly means, then the criteria must follow suit. The criteria
          could also set the new standard of what the product should achieve
          when it comes to eco-friendliness.
